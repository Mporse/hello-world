Hello there! (General cannoli!)

I'm sdaM. I like gaming, biology, but has as of recently gotten more into IT and learned a bunch of Python, some R and a little bit of Java. I hope to get more into Data Science / Bioinformatics in the future.
Despite being Scandinavian, I absolutely love Italian food. Also, I cherish (salt) liquorice, ice cream and cake.
