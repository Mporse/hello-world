Hello there! (General cannoli!)

I'm sdaM. I like gaming, biology, but has as of recently gotten more into IT and learned a bunch a Python and some Java. I hope to get more into Data Science / Bioinformatics in the future.
Despite being Scandinavian, I absolutely love Italian food. Also, I cherish (salt) liquorice ice cream and cake.

I'm a scat man!
